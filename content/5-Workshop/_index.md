# Fighting Game AWS Backend — Implementation Workshop

Hands-on steps for the **serverless + EC2 Spot** multiplayer game backend documented in my internship proposal. This section covers the infrastructure and CI/CD work I was responsible for on the [fighting-game](https://github.com/Nothingtoread/fighting-game) project.

**Region:** `ap-southeast-1`  
**Scope:** EC2 warm pool fleet, S3 static client hosting, IAM, GitHub OIDC, CodeDeploy (Lambda + EC2), async match analytics, private MatchMaker VPC, live game demo, and documented teardown.
